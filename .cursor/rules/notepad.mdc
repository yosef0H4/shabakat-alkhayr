have file called notepad.txt where you save all the info you think it is useful and got it wrong if it doesnt exsist make it ONLY WRITE IN NOTEPAD IF IT WORKS after the code you grabbed makes no errors add it to notepad

always assume your knowalge is outdate and look for information on the web/notepad before writing code
every time you face an error try to  fix it once and only once then if that fix doesnt work always search the web/notepad 
if something you just discovered and was outside of your knowalge add it to the notepad so you dont have to look it up in the web again


check notepad first then search the web if you cant find your answer
