## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Convex:**
    *   Install the Convex CLI if you haven't already:
        ```bash
        npm install -g convex
        ```
    *   Log in to your Convex account:
        ```bash
        npx convex login
        ```
    *   Initialize Convex for this project (if not already done):
        ```bash
        npx convex init
        ```
    *   This will create a `convex.json` file and link your project to a Convex backend.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add your Convex deployment URL:
        ```env
        VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment-name.convex.cloud
        ```
    *   To enable password and/or anonymous authentication with `@convex-dev/auth`, you'll typically set these in your Convex dashboard environment variables (not in `.env.local` for the Vite client, but in the Convex backend settings):
        *   `CONVEX_AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED="true"`
        *   `CONVEX_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED="true"`
        (Refer to `@convex-dev/auth` documentation for the most up-to-date setup).

5.  **Deploy Convex Functions & Schema:**
    ```bash
    npx convex deploy
    ```
    Or, to run Convex in development mode with hot-reloading for backend changes:
    ```bash
    npx convex dev
    ```
    This command will also provide you with the `VITE_CONVEX_URL` if you don't have it yet.

## ‡∂∞ Running the Application

1.  **Start the Convex backend development server (if not already running from setup):**
    ```bash
    npx convex dev
    ```
    Keep this running in a separate terminal.

2.  **Start the Vite frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## ü§ñ Using the AI Chat Assistant

The AI Chat Assistant uses the Google Gemini API. To use this feature:
1.  Navigate to the "AI Chat" tab in the application.
2.  You will be prompted to enter your Google Gemini API Key.
3.  Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).
4.  Paste the key into the input field in the app and save. The key is stored locally in your browser's local storage.
